# 🎯 Interactive Tooltip Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Your Feng Shui AI app now has **interactive tooltips** that highlight specific objects in the room image with good/bad/neutral feng shui indicators!

## 🔄 Complete Flow

### 1. **Upload Image** → User uploads room photo

### 2. **Object Detection** → YOLOv8 detects objects & coordinates
```json
{
  "class": "chair",
  "confidence": 0.935,
  "bbox": {"x1": 463, "y1": 368, "x2": 712, "y2": 802},
  "center": {"x": 587, "y": 585}
}
```

### 3. **Gemini Analysis** → AI analyzes with object context
- Receives list of detected objects
- Generates JSON response with:
  - Overall feng shui score (1-10)
  - Strengths & weaknesses
  - **Object-specific tooltips** with indices

### 4. **Coordinate Mapping** → Backend combines tooltips + coordinates
```json
{
  "score": 7,
  "tooltips": [
    {
      "object_class": "bed",
      "object_index": 4,
      "type": "bad",
      "message": "Bed positioned directly under window - disrupts energy flow",
      "coordinates": {
        "bbox": {...},
        "center": {"x": 1267, "y": 732}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. **Interactive Visualization** → Frontend displays tooltips on image
- Bounding boxes around objects
- Color-coded markers (green/red/yellow)
- Hover to see details
- Responsive tooltip cards at bottom

## 📁 Files Modified

### Backend
- **[backend/main.py](../backend/main.py)**
  - `get_gemini_client()`: Lazy client initialization (fixed cleanup error)
  - `call_gemini_fengshui()`: Updated to accept objects, return JSON
  - `/analyze/` endpoint: Combines detection + analysis with coordinates

### Frontend
- **[frontend/components/FengShuiVisualization.tsx](../frontend/components/FengShuiVisualization.tsx)**: New interactive visualization component
- **[frontend/app/upload/page.tsx](../frontend/app/upload/page.tsx)**: Updated to display structured results with tooltips

## 🎨 Tooltip Types

### ✅ Good (Green)
- Positive feng shui placement

## 🎯 Hackathon Demo Script

### Step 1: Introduction
"Our Feng Shui AI uses computer vision and AI to analyze rooms and provide actionable insights."

### Step 2: Upload & Detection
"Watch as we upload this room photo... YOLOv8 detects objects like the bed, chairs, and desk."

### Step 3: Interactive Visualization
"Now see the magic - Gemini analyzes each object's feng shui impact. The red box shows this bed placement is bad - it's under a window, disrupting energy flow."

### Step 4: Detailed Analysis
"We get a score of 7/10, with specific strengths and weaknesses. Plus actionable suggestions to improve to 9 or 10."

### Step 5: Technical Stack
"This combines:
- Auth0 for authentication
- Echo for monetization
- YOLOv8 for object detection
- Gemini for AI analysis
- React for interactive UI"
